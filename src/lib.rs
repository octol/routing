//! Client and node implementations for a resilient decentralised network.
//!
//! The network is based on the [`kademlia_routing_table`][1] and uses the XOR metric to define the
//! "distance" between two [`XorName`][2]s. `XorName`s are used as addresses of nodes, clients as
//! well as data.
//!
//! [1]: ../kademlia_routing_table/index.html
//! [2]: ../xor_name/struct.XorName.html
//!
//! Messages are exchanged between _authorities_, where an `Authority` can be an individual client
//! or node, or a collection of nodes called a "section", or a subset of a section called a "group".
//! In all cases, messages are cryptographically signed by the sender, and in the case of sections
//! and groups, it is verified that a sufficient number of members agree on the message: only if
//! that quorum is reached, the message is delivered. In addition, each message has a unique ID, and
//! is delivered only once.
//!
//! Section and group authorities are also addressed using a single `XorName`. The members are the
//! nodes that are closest to that name. Sections contain a minimum number of nodes with the minimum
//! value specified as a network-wide constant. Groups are of fixed size, defined as the above
//! minimum section size. Since nodes are assigned their name by the network, this provides
//! redundancy and resilience: a node has no control over which section or group authority it will
//! be a member of, and without a majority in the section or group it cannot forge a message from
//! there.
//!
//! The library also provides different types for the messages' data.
//!
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! `Node` is used to handle and send requests within that network, and to implement its
//! functionality, e.g. storing and retrieving data, validating permissions, managing metadata, etc.
